Alright, above are just some insignificant words for basic introduction. I am a 20-years-old male born and raised in China mainland, currently live in China and i'm a student of Tianjin university. I really love my country and my culture, but i'm learning this ‘universal’ language so i decided to write this blog in English. For those who just use Chinese or other languages, i sincerely offer you my apology for making you use translator to read this blog.
